<b>IOI'94 - Day 1</b>
</center>

<p> In a stroke of luck almost beyond imagination, Farmer John was
sent a ticket to the Irish Sweepstakes (really a lottery) for his
birthday.  This ticket turned out to have only the winning number
for the lottery!  Farmer John won a fabulous castle in the Irish
countryside.

<p> Bragging rights being what they are in Wisconsin, Farmer John
wished to tell his cows all about the castle.  He wanted to know
how many rooms it has and how big the largest room was.  In fact,
he wants to take out a single wall to make an even bigger room.

<p> Your task is to help Farmer John know the exact room count and
sizes.

<p>The castle floorplan is divided into M (wide) by N (1 &lt;=M,N&lt;=50)
square modules.  Each such module can have between zero and four
walls.  Castles always have walls on their "outer edges" to keep
out the wind and rain.

<p>Consider this annotated floorplan of a castle:
<pre>
     1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   #############################
 1 #   |   #   |   #   |   |   #
   #####---#####---#---#####---#   
 2 #   #   |   #   #   #   #   #
   #---#####---#####---#####---#
 3 #   |   |   #   #   #   #   #   
   #---#########---#####---#---#
 4 # ->#   |   |   |   |   #   #   
   ############################# 

#  = Wall     -,|  = No wall
-> = Points to the wall to remove to
     make the largest possible new room
</pre>

<p>By way of example, this castle sits on a 7 x 4 base.  A "room" includes
any set of connected "squares" in the floor plan.  This floorplan contains
five rooms (whose sizes are 9, 7, 3, 1, and 8 in no particular order).

<p>Removing the wall marked by the arrow merges a pair of rooms to
make the largest possible room that can be made by removing a single
wall.

<p> The castle always has at least two rooms and always has a wall
that can be removed.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: castle</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The map is stored in the form of numbers, one number for each module,
M numbers on each of N lines to describe the floorplan.  The input
order corresponds to the numbering in the example diagram above.

<p>Each module number tells how many of the four walls exist and
is the sum of up to four integers:
<ul>
<li>1: wall to the west </li>
<li>2: wall to the north </li>
<li>4: wall to the east </li>
<li>8: wall to the south </li>
</ul>
<p>Inner walls are defined twice; a wall to the south in module 1,1
is also indicated as a wall to the north in module 2,1.

<table border="1">
<tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> Two space-separated integers: M and N</td>
<tr> <td> Line 2..: </td> <td>M x N integers, several per line.
</td>
</table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file castle.in) </h3>

<pre>
7 4
11 6 11 6 3 10 6
7 9 6 13 5 15 5
1 10 12 7 13 7 5
13 11 10 8 10 12 13
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The output contains several lines:
<table border="1">
<tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> The number of rooms the castle has.
<tr> <td> Line 2: </td> <td> The size of the largest room</td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 3: </td> <td> The size of the largest room creatable by removing one wall
</td>
<tr> <td> Line 4: </td> <td> The single wall to remove to make the
largest room possible</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Choose the optimal wall to remove from the set of optimal walls
by choosing the module farthest to the west (and then, if still
tied, farthest to the south). If still tied, choose 'N' before 'E'.
Name that wall by naming the module that borders it on either the
west or south, along with a direction of N or E giving the location
of the wall with respect to the module.
