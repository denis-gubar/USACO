<h1>Mixing Milk</h1>
</center>

<p>The Merry Milk Makers company buys milk from farmers, packages
it into attractive 1- and 2-Unit bottles, and then sells that milk
to grocery stores so we can each start our day with delicious cereal
and milk.

<p>Since milk packaging is such a difficult business in which to
make money, it is important to keep the costs as low as possible.
Help Merry Milk Makers purchase the farmers' milk in the cheapest
possible manner. The MMM company has an extraordinarily talented
marketing department and knows precisely how much milk they need
each day to package for their customers.

<p>The company has contracts with several farmers from whom they
may purchase milk, and each farmer has a (potentially) different
price at which they sell milk to the packing plant.
Of course, a herd of cows can only produce so much milk each
day, so the farmers already know how much milk they will have
available.

<p>Each day, Merry Milk Makers can purchase an integer number of
units of milk from each farmer, a number that is always less than
or equal to the farmer's limit (and might be the entire production
from that farmer, none of the production, or any integer in between).

<p>Given:
<ul>
<li>The Merry Milk Makers' daily requirement of milk
<li>The cost per unit for milk from each farmer
<li>The amount of milk available from each farmer
</ul>
calculate the minimum amount of money that Merry Milk Makers must
spend to meet their daily need for milk.

<p>Note: The total milk produced per day by the farmers will always
be sufficient to meet the demands of the Merry Milk Makers even if
the prices are high.
