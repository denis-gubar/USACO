<p>Farmer John has N hills on his farm (1 <= N <= 1,000), each with
an integer elevation in the range 0 .. 100. In the winter, since
there is abundant snow on these hills, FJ routinely operates a ski
training camp.

<p>Unfortunately, FJ has just found out about a new tax that will
be assessed next year on farms used as ski training camps. Upon
careful reading of the law, however, he discovers that the official
definition of a ski camp requires the difference between the highest
and lowest hill on his property to be strictly larger than 17.
Therefore, if he shortens his tallest hills and adds mass to increase
the height of his shorter hills, FJ can avoid paying the tax as
long as the new difference between the highest and lowest hill is
at most 17.

<p>If it costs x^2 units of money to change the height of a hill
by x units, what is the minimum amount of money FJ will need to
pay? FJ can change the height of a hill only once, so the total
cost for each hill is the square of the difference between its
original and final height.  FJ is only willing to change the height
of each hill by an integer amount.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: skidesign</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT:</h3>

<table>

<tr><td>Line 1:</td><td>The integer N.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Lines 2..1+N:</td><td>Each line contains the elevation of
a single hill.</tr></td>

</table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file skidesign.in):</h3>

</pre>

<h3>INPUT DETAILS:</h3>

<p>FJ's farm has 5 hills, with elevations 1, 4, 20, 21, and 24.

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT:</h3>

<table>
<tr><td>Line 1:</td></td>The minimum amount FJ needs to pay to
modify the elevations of his hills so the difference between largest
and smallest is at most 17 units.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file skidesign.out):</h3>

<h3>OUTPUT DETAILS:</h3>

<p>FJ keeps the hills of heights 4, 20, and 21 as they are. He adds
mass to the hill of height 1, bringing it to height 4 (cost = 3^2
= 9). He shortens the hill of height 24 to height 21, also at a
cost of 3^2 = 9.
